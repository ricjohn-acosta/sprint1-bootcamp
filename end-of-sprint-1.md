<h3>T1 - Learning about version control(git) and the CLI.</h3>

<b>1. In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</b>
- The CLI is the non-graphical alternative to the GUI of the operating system.

<b>2. Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</b>
- I chose to use the pomodoro technique as a time management tool.

<b>3. Name 5 commands you used and what they do.</b>
- ls = checks folders in current directory.
- cd = change directory.
- mkdir = make folder
- rm -rf = delete file/folders.
- git clone = clone remote repository.

<b>4.) Did you learn anything unexpected?</b>
- Everything looks like my experience I had with the tech so far so nothing unexpected to me yet.

<h3>T2 - Version control with git.</h3>

<b>What's the difference between git and GitHub?</b>
- Git is the underlying software that is in charge of all of the functionalities for version control while GitHub only serves as the "hub" for files that are under version control.

<b>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</b>
- Restaurant analogy. Git is the one in the kitchen(doing all the cloning, branching, pushing) while GitHub is served to the public(users).

<b>Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</b>
- I believe that I will as I will be using Git and GitHub a lot all throughout the bootcamp.

<b>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</b>
- I have some experience regarding the topic. It served as a nice refresher and I felt like the time I spent on T2 is adequate.

<h3>T3 - Git</h3>

<b>What is a GitHub work flow</b>
- The process of making a new branch, committing in said branch, requesting a pull and compare two branches and, finally, merging.

<b>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</b>
- Self-learning is doing good so far. I usually just use google if I encounter any problems.

<b>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</b>
- I am pretty satisfied with the learning that I have done.
