<h3>T1 - Learning about version control(git) and the CLI.</h3>

1. In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
- The CLI is the non-graphical alternative to the GUI of the operating system.

2. Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
- I chose to use the pomodoro technique as a time management tool.

3. Name 5 commands you used and what they do.
- ls = checks folders in current directory.
- cd = change directory.
- mkdir = make folder
- rm -rf = delete file/folders.
- git clone = clone remote repository.

4.) Did you learn anything unexpected?
- Everything looks like my experience I had with the tech so far so nothing unexpected to me yet.
